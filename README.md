# Graduate Project

## 1. Preprocess Data

We strongly recommend you use Google Colab to complete this part preparation. All codes are in dirflower/src/py/data_preprocess

For Cora, you just need to prepare data and use code in pyMetis_cora.

For PubMed, you have to use pubmed_preprocess first. Then you can use pymetis_med to partition the data.
